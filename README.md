# Prometheus Voting Vision

This is the full code for the Prometheus Voting Vision project (PCA + NN). 

Use run testVoting.java in the source folder to demo the code. 

- There will be a list of commands once run allowing you to run either PCA, or the Neural Network portion. 
- Lines 79-84 can be edited to change the parameters for PCA before running. 
- The commands for the neural networks are segmented as you'll see when running. You can load, train, and test neural networks with different commands. You can also run the image manipulation algorithms without running the Neural Network.
- Try.java & Demo.java are just two halves of testVoting.java (when the two halves of this project were separated), so you can ignore those

## PCA.zip & VotingVisionNN.zip

The two sides of this project were developed separately, so if you'd like to see which files correspond to a certain half of this project, you can consult these two files.
